# Scraper Script
A scraper script I used at the launch of new graphics cards. Even though the demand for the product was higher than its availability, I managed to get a graphics card with the help of this script :)!

The script was designed specifically for the www.caseking.de graphics card section. You might want to alternate the scraping for other pages. As soon as the availability of the products changes, an email gets send to the desired recipient with the corresponding url.
